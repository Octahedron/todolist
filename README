#A Sample/Blank project for Cotopaxi development.

## About CTPX

This project cames with the 'ctpx tool'. Ctpx makes easy to configure and run projects using cotopaxi.
It uses maven and other dependencies to make all the magic works. 
If you have no experience with maven, we recommend you to take a look at the Maven2 documentation,
but don't worry, this script will make it easy (we hope)! If you are using eclipse, install the 
m2clipse plugin.

The ctpx tool works well on Ubuntu (natty) environments.

Feel free to modify these tool to other distros and let us know!

To start, try 'ctpx help'.

## Using this project without the 'ctpx tool'

TBD
